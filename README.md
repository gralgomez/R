# Revision of the Solow growth model with R

## Description

This repository provides a revision of the Solow growth model based on the paper of Mankiw, Romer & Weil (1992) (source).*Gregory N. Mankiw, David Romer, and David N. Weil. A contribution to the empirics of economic growth. Number 3541 in Working Paper Series. December 1992.*

The model was replicated and tested in R. Also, the original results of Mankiw, Romer & Weil (1960 - 1985) were enhanced with up-to-date data (1985 - 2010). This project is documented in the paper:*Maike Warneke, Justs Hövelmann, Laura Gabrysiak Gomez. A Revision of the Solow Model in R. Humbold University. July 2015.*
